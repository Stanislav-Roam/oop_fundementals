# S.O.L.I.D

## Single responsibility Principle
A class or service should only have a single responsibility

## Open/Closed Principle
A class or service should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subclasses without altering the correctness of that program

## Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on the interfaces they do not use

## Dependency Inversion Principle
Program to an interface, not to an implementation
